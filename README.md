CMake platform files for old and/or obscure platforms.

# Warning
These are as-is and are giant hacks and will not support all features.
Please use them sensibly. I'm not responsible for anything that happens if you use this.

# Currently added
cc65.cmake: Use cc65 to build commodore64 executables
opentatcom-dos.cmake: Use OpenWatcom 2 to compile a 486 DOS executable with a dos4gw loader

# Why this repository?
I had these files in various projects. I wanted to keep them safe somewhere so I don't have to
fiddle around with all the commandline arguments if I need it again.
